    <div class='hello'>
      <h3>Hello!</h3>
      <p>
        I’m Fred Patterson, Lawn Care enthusiast and small business owner.
        <br><br>
        I care for lawns in your neighborhood and wanted to introduce myself. Over 10 
        years ago I started transforming lawns as a hobby and now it’s a passion. I 
        serve residential and commercial clients, and love what I do.

      <h3>Why I Love What I Do</h3>
      <p>
        The gratitude of a satisfied customer when their lawn transformation is 
        complete, and their ability to tale pride in the outside of their property as 
        much as the interior. I also enjoy the process, welcoming the challenge of 
        transforming lawns. I have the tenacity, patience, and skill to transform and 
        grow the most difficult lawns to their best!
        <br><br>
        If you are not satisfied with your lawn today, contact me for a complimentary 
        inspection and a competitive quote!
